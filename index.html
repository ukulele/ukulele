        <h1>The Balham Ukulele Society Songbook Project</h1>

<h2>The aim</h2>

<p>Is to have a system of writing and typesetting songs in a open format that can easily be assembled into printable sheets and books, in a variety of sizes, layouts and font sizes. The secondary aim is to allow and encourage corrections, and new songs to be quickly incorporated.</p>

<h3>The projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>Songbook</li>
<li>Songsheet Maker</li>
</ul><h4>Songbook</h4>

<p>This is a collection of LaTeX projects. LaTeX is an excellent, mature, typesetting system which generates PDFs for us, and the songs are all stored in this format, along with various master documents that encompass:</p>

<ul>
<li>Archived songs</li>
<li>New songs</li>
<li>Special occasion songs</li>
<li>Single songs</li>
</ul><p>There's plenty of flexibility. The idea was to not have one hefty master songbook, but instead several smaller ones.</p>

<h4>Songsheet Maker</h4>

<p>LaTeX formatting is not simple or particularly easy, but songs are quite straightforward. So we created a simple format for writing a song that was easily-readable, but could be parsed by a machine and converted to a LaTeX format. This project is a database-driven Ruby on Rails application that allows the editing of the simple format, and the real-time conversation/display into LaTeX format, which can be copied and pasted into a Songbook project and used.</p>

<h3>Balham Ukulele Society</h3>

<p>Is informally based in and around Balham, more specifically The Balham Bowls Club pub, which is one of South London's finest. Great staff, lovely beer, late licence, a brilliantly quirky and usable layout and very near the tube. We meet there for a fortnightly jam session on Sundays at 7pm. Lessons are beforehand, if you have booked.</p>

<p>We are frequently asked to play parties, festivals and other public events.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more, splendid, we're available in the pub, or via email <a href="mailto:balhamukulelesociety@gmail.com">balhamukulelesociety@gmail.com</a></p>
